This is a personal repository to store useful code for myself. It was inspired by this blog post:
    https://hilaryparker.com/2013/04/03/personal-r-packages/

Feel free to use any of it that you might find handy; especially if you feel inspired to start your own personal repository and share it for the benefits of others and yourself! This README will include a list of all functions and a brief description.
